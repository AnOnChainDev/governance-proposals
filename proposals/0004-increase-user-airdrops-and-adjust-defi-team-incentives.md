# SBGP-0004: Increase User Airdrops and Adjust DeFi Team Incentives
SolBlaze would like to propose a change to the BlazeStake airdrops where user airdrops are increased by replacing the airdrop allocation to DeFi teams with a rewards multiplier system. This change will increase user airdrops by more than 40% and will not decrease emissions.

## Proposed Change
Currently, more than 30% of BLZE in airdrops is given to DeFi teams that maintain protocols in proportion to their bSOL-related TVL. This allocation was initially established when bSOL was not widely used in DeFi, and the BLZE airdrop to DeFi teams was an incentive that encouraged DeFi protocols to specifically promote their bSOL integrations. As a result, the TVL of BlazeStake initially increased since DeFi integrations encouraged users to switch to bSOL in their protocols.

However, bSOL is now one of the most widely used tokens in DeFi, and this BLZE incentive to DeFi teams is no longer being used as productively. DeFi protocols now benefit much more from the added TVL from existing bSOL users than BlazeStake benefits from potential increases in its TVL. Furthermore, the expectation that BlazeStake users will utilize bSOL in DeFi regardless of protocol-specific efforts has decreased alignment and motivation for DeFi teams to advocate specifically for bSOL usage in their protocols.

Instead, DeFi teams that make significant contributions to the SolBlaze ecosystem should be highlighed through special airdrop multipliers to users of their protocols, giving increased airdrops to their users and bringing more bSOL TVL into protocols that are more aligned with SolBlaze's mission. DeFi teams should advocate for why they should receive these multipliers and what special contributions they are making or will make in return. The SolBlaze DAO can vote on these multipliers every few weeks and adjust these parameters accordingly.

Emissions from SolBlaze to DeFi users will remain completely unchanged as part of this proposal, and airdrops to users will naturally increase due to the removal of the DeFi team airdrop allocation (more than 30% of BLZE airdrops will be reallocated to users proportionally instead of DeFi teams, which will result in more than a 40% increase in BLZE airdrops for users). Pending airdrops to DeFi teams for this airdrops cycle will be sent to the SolBlaze DAO.

## Implementation Details
The parameters of airdrop distribution will be updated such that DeFi teams no longer receive BLZE airdrops, and instead these airdrops are distributed proportionally among users. Additionally, a forum will be opened where DeFi teams can apply for rewards multipliers to their protocols to bring in more TVL, and the DAO can vote on which protocols should receive these multipliers based on their team's contributions and plans related to growing the SolBlaze ecosystem.

## Voting
Yes - The airdrop distribution will be updated in accordance with this proposal and a forum will be created for DeFi protocols

No - The airdrop distribution will remain unchanged and no forum will be created

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the airdrop distribution parameters will be updated and the forum will be created during the same week. Pending airdrops to DeFi teams will be sent to the SolBlaze DAO by the next airdrop.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
