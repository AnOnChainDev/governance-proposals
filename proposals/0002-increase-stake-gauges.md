# SBGP-0002: Increase Stake Gauges
SolBlaze would like to propose a change to the BlazeStake standard delegation strategy where 20% of stake under this strategy would be controlled by the BLZE gauge-based voting system. This proposal will be the first in a planned series of increases over the next few quarters to kickstart the BLZE wars.

## Proposed Change
The current breakdown of the BlazeStake standard delegation strategy is as follows:
- 80% algorithmic strategy (distributed across hundreds of validators with the goal of increasing decentralization of the network)
- 10% BLZE gauges (allows BLZE holders to vote on which validators should receive this stake through the BLZE gauge-based voting model)
- 10% BlazeBoost matching pool (used to boost stake done through Custom Liquid Staking as an incentive for validators to promote BlazeStake usage)

The new BlazeStake standard delegation would follow this breakdown:
- 70% algorithmic strategy (distributed across hundreds of validators with the goal of increasing decentralization of the network)
- 20% BLZE gauges (allows BLZE holders to vote on which validators should receive this stake through the BLZE gauge-based voting model)
- 10% BlazeBoost matching pool (used to boost stake done through Custom Liquid Staking as an incentive for validators to promote BlazeStake usage)

Further increases to the percentage of the delegation strategy controlled by BLZE gauges may be done over time to increase BLZE's utility.

## Implementation Details
The parameters of the delegation strategy will be updated in accordance with a 70/20/10 split instead of the previous 80/10/10 split.

## Voting
Yes - The delegation strategy will be updated in accordance with this proposal

No - The delegation strategy will remain unchanged

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the delegation strategy parameters will be updated during the same week. Stake in the pool will be rebalanced according to the new delegation strategy once the next first weekly veBLZE vote weight snapshot is taken for the gauges.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
