# DRAFT-1: Adjust Protocol Airdrops
SolBlaze would like to propose a change to the BlazeStake protocol airdrops (the incentives given to protocol teams, not to users) where the airdrops will be sent as max-locked veBLZE instead of unlocked BLZE.

## Proposed Change
Currently, BLZE is airdropped to teams that maintain protocols in proportion to their bSOL-related TVL. However, that BLZE is currently airdropped in its fully unlocked form, which reduces alignment between these protocols and SolBlaze. This change would switch theses airdrops to be done in max-locked veBLZE, incentivizing protocol participation in governance/gauges and ensuring long-term alignment between protocols and SolBlaze.

Airdrops and emissions from SolBlaze to DeFi users will remain completely unchanged as part of this proposal.

## Implementation Details
The parameters of airdrop distribution will be updated such that protocols receive max-locked veBLZE through Realms instead of unlocked BLZE sent directly to their wallets.

## Voting
Yes - The airdrop distribution will be updated in accordance with this proposal

No - The airdrop distribution will remain unchanged

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the airdrop distribution parameters will be updated during the same week. 

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
