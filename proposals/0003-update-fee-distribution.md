# SBGP-0003: Update Fee Distribution
SolBlaze would like to propose a change to the BlazeStake fee distribution where 50% of fees will be sent to the SolBlaze DAO. 

## Proposed Change
The current breakdown of the BlazeStake fee distribution is as follows:
- 50% operational/team expenses
- 20% protocol-owned liquidity
- 20% future BLZE burns
- 10% SolBlaze DAO

The new BlazeStake standard delegation would follow this breakdown:
- 50% operational/team expenses
- 50% SolBlaze DAO

Fee revenues will be sent to the SolBlaze DAO in BLZE, and the DAO may choose to burn this allocation of BLZE through ceremonial monthly votes.

Additionally, around 49.21m BLZE representing approximately 0.5% of the total BLZE supply (the amount previously allocated to future BLZE burns) will be sent to the DAO, which may also choose to burn this allocation through the same voting process.

## Implementation Details
The parameters of the fee distribution will be updated in accordance with a 50/50 split instead of the previous 50/20/10/10 split. Around 49.21m BLZE will be transferred to the DAO, and further fee distributions will be periodically sent to the DAO as BLZE.

## Voting
Yes - The fee distribution will be updated in accordance with this proposal

No - The fee distribution will remain unchanged

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the fee distribution parameters will be updated during the same week. Around 49.21m BLZE will be transferred to the DAO's fee wallet as part of the same timeline.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
